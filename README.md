# Elixir

## To run the code, follow these steps:

- Make sure you have Elixir installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the official Elixir website: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html
- Create a new Elixir project or navigate to an existing project directory where you want to add this code.
- Create a new file with the extension .ex (e.g., a2.ex) and open it in a text editor.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
- Run the Elixir interactive shell by typing iex in the terminal and pressing Enter.
- Inside the Elixir shell, compile the code by entering the following command: c("a2.ex"). Replace "a2.ex" with the actual name of your file if it's different.
- Once the code is compiled without any errors, you can execute the A2.main() function to run the code. Type A2.main() in the Elixir shell and press Enter.
- The code will read the contents of the "../sample-input" file and process it. The output will be displayed in the terminal.
- Make sure you have the "../sample-input" file present in the specified location. If the file is located elsewhere or has a different name, you'll need to modify the A2.main() function to match the correct file path.

Note: The code assumes the presence of a specific input file ("../sample-input") for processing. Make sure you have a file with the correct name and location, or modify the A2.main() function to read the desired input file.
